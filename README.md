<h1>ENIGMA SIMULATOR </h1> is the implementation of the enigma cypher used in the Second World War.<br/>
The program encrypts normal words  , and decodes encrypted words. <br/>
This is a 3 rotor implementation including a plugboard.<br />
The plugboard has been implemented using Binary Search Trees data structure.<br />
The Rotors and key matching has been implemented using pointers and arrays data structure.</br>
<h4>INPUT---></h4>

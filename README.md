# Enigma_Simulator
<h1>ENIGMA SIMULATOR </h1> is the implementation of the enigma cypher used in the Second World War.<br/>
The program encrypts normal words  , and decodes encrypted words. <br/>
This is a 3 rotor implementation including a plugboard.<br />
The plugboard has been implemented using Binary Search Trees data structure.<br />
The Rotors and key matching has been implemented using pointers and arrays data structure.<br />
INPUT ---><br />
Enter the key new : (Enter a 3 lettered word , which is the Key bassed on which encryption takes place.)<br />
Enter the word : (Enter the word to be encrypted . shoud be lesser than 10 characters)<br />
1.Encrypt 2.Decrypt (choose Options) <br />
